Well, the most astonishing discovery in our recent researches is a complex combination of Transmutation, Astral and Nature Magic to animate wooden figurines. Did you notice the Guards around the house? Originally those were simple nutcrackers, carved out of wood by our talented carpenters. With the results of our magic researches, we were able to transform them into animated beings, acting rudimentary self-determined and capable to perform simple tasks. At the moment we can keep them animated for an unlimited time, as long as the caster stays in range.\""; next;
